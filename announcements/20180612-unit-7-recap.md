# Unit 6 Recap

Hello students,

For a recap of last night's activities, reference the [Unit 7 Agenda](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/units/unit-7/agenda.md), and view the [Unit 7 Video](http://nyustern.mediasite.com/Mediasite/Play/9475a3508c3b45fdb1dea497792323cd1d).

During the beginning of class, we installed Git Client applications of choice and worked independently and collaboratively on a [Version Control Exercise](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/exercises/version-control/exercise.md).

During the second half of class, I walked through most of the remaining parts of the [Stock Recommendation App](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/projects/stocks-app/project.md) project.

Please submit your project before Wednesday around 5pm. If you have questions, post them to Slack! Otherwise, I will be holding office hours in the classroom starting at 5pm on Wednesday, in case anyone needs extra help.

See you on Wednesday night, when we will be discussing the Management of Software Development and the Systems Development Lifecycle (SDLC), and participating in an interactive "Design Thinking" workshop.

\- Professor Rossetti
