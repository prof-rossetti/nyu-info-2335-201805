# Unit 4 Recap

Hello students,

I had a serious amount of fun in class last night. Thank you! For a recap of activities, reference the [Unit 4 Agenda](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/units/unit-4/agenda.md), and view the [Unit 4 Video](http://nyustern.mediasite.com/Mediasite/Play/bc5ed471bd604fb6af9aa03d53b8925f1d).

After working in pairs on the CSV Processing Exercise, we got started on the [Inventory Management App](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/projects/inventory-app/project.md), which is due by next Wednesday at 5pm. I highly encourage you to get as far as you can before class next Monday night. I will be holding office hours in the classroom before class, so stop by then if you need help.

Have a great weekend, and I'll see you again on Monday night, when we will learn about APIs and processing data from the Internet.

\- Professor Rossetti

PS - Please remember to submit your [Weekly Check-in](https://goo.gl/forms/6MiFYOcwBdDulp763) sometime between Thursday at 9am and Monday at 9am. If you see a grade of 0.5 in the NYU Classes Gradebook for any Weekly Check-in, it means it was not submitted within the specified window. And It would be unfortunate for anyone to lose points over this in the future.
