# Unit 4 Recap

Hello students,

I had a serious amount of fun in class last night. Thank you! For a recap of activities, reference the [Unit 4 Agenda](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/units/unit-4/agenda.md), and view the [Unit 4 Video](http://nyustern.mediasite.com/Mediasite/Play/bc5ed471bd604fb6af9aa03d53b8925f1d).

After working in pairs on the CSV Processing Exercise, we worked together to get started on the [Inventory Management App](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/projects/inventory-app/project.md), which is due by next Wednesday at 5pm. This is going to take more time than you think, so I highly encourage you to get as far as you can before class next Monday night. I will be holding office hours in the classroom before class, so stop by then if you need help.

Have a great weekend, and I'll see you again on Monday night, when we will learn about APIs and processing data from the Internet. Maybe one of the best classes of the semester, so hope to see you there!

\- Professor Rossetti

PS - Please remember to submit your [Weekly Check-in](https://goo.gl/forms/6MiFYOcwBdDulp763) sometime between Thursday at 9am and Monday at 9am. If you see a grade of 0.5 in the NYU Classes Gradebook for any Weekly Check-in, it means it was not submitted within the specified window. And It would be unfortunate for anyone to lose points over this in the future.
