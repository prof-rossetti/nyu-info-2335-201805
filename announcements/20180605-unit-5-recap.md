# Unit 5 Recap

Hello students,

For a recap of last night's activities, reference the [Unit 5 Agenda](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/units/unit-5/agenda.md), and view the [Unit 5 Video](http://nyustern.mediasite.com/Mediasite/Play/8166863c204742fbb4a7672587b759251d).

We took some time to work on the [Inventory Management App](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/projects/inventory-app/project.md), which is due by Wednesday at 5pm. Then we learned how to test our Python applications in an automated way.

It's important to me that all students receive enough individual attention and support. So if you are feeling behind or super stressed out, stop by the classroom for office hours sometime after 5pm on Wednesday, and I will try to help you out.

On Wednesday night, we will be focusing on APIs and processing data from the Internet (really this time). See you then!

\- Professor Rossetti
