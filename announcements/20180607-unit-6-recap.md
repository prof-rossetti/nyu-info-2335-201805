# Unit 6 Recap

Hello students,

For a recap of last night's activities, reference the [Unit 6 Agenda](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/units/unit-6/agenda.md), and view the [Unit 6 Video](http://nyustern.mediasite.com/Mediasite/Play/33fa2307818b4cdaa2aaf79255fc876f1d).

We spent most of class working independently and collaboratively on the agenda activities. During the process, we noticed the `dotenv` package wasn't working for some students, regardless of operating system. I have filed an [issue](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/issues/157) to look into this further. But in the meantime, my message to you is: "find a way to set environment variables that works for you, and stick with it". If the `dotenv` approach doesn't work for you, I recommend the following:

  + For Windows students, set environment variables from the command line using `set`.
  + For Mac students, manage your environment variables from your `~/.bash_profile` file.

Let's continue to talk in Slack over the weekend to share solutions related to environment variables.

Please remember to submit your [Weekly Check-in](https://goo.gl/forms/6MiFYOcwBdDulp763) sometime between Thursday at 9am and Monday at 9am.

Otherwise see how far you can get in the [Stock Recommendation App](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/projects/stocks-app/project.md) project, which is due by next Wednesday at 5pm. If you have questions, post them to Slack! Otherwise, I will be holding office hours in the classroom starting at 5pm on Monday.

Next class we will most likely be taking a break from Python and transitioning to learning command-line Git, and I hope to also provide you with more time to work on your projects.

Have a great weekend everyone! :smiley:
