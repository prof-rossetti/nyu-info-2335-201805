# Unit 3 Recap

Hello students,

For a recap of last night's activities, reference the [Unit 3 Agenda](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/units/unit-3/agenda.md), and view the [Unit 3 Video](http://nyustern.mediasite.com/Mediasite/Play/fdc008f03b594348aea8d49ae7a80b8f1d).

After finishing the Python Datatypes Exercise, we worked together through most of the [Point-of-Sale App](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/projects/point-of-sale-app/project.md), which is due by next Wednesday at 5pm. If you need help with the submission process, send me a message or ask for help in the `#2335` Slack channel.

As a reminder, we won't be having class next Monday because of Memorial Day. Have a great long weekend, and I'll see you again next Wednesday night as we learn how to process data from CSV files.

\- Professor Rossetti
