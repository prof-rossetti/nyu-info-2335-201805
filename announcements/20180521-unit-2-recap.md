# Unit 2 Recap

Hey everyone,

Awesome job tonight in class. I appreciated your diligence in working through the written materials, and your engagement in collaborating on the programming exercise. And good job continuing to help each other!

For a recap of tonight's activities, reference the [Unit 2 Agenda](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/units/unit-2/agenda.md), and view the [Unit 2 Video](http://nyustern.mediasite.com/Mediasite/Play/329e0e5d619549339f4456cde60e75241d).

Next class we will introduce a few more Python programming concepts and spend a majority of class time working through the first graded project, the Point-of-Sale App. See you then!

\- Professor Rossetti

But don't worry if you aren't able to do so, as we will be finishing this exercise together at the beginning of next class.

PPS - By now, I have merged all outstanding Pull Requests, so if you submitted the Human Software Exercise, you should see a corresponding record in the [Human Software Submissions](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/exercises/human-software/submissions.csv) file, and before next class I will email you to provide a receipt for any extra credit earned.
