# Welcome

Hello students,

Welcome to *Python Programming & Fundamentals of Software Development*. I'm excited to meet you all during our first class on Wednesday night.

In the meantime, please take a few minutes before the beginning of class to submit the [Onboarding Survey](https://goo.gl/forms/UhXUqDUVE0pgeQlK2). Also please take this time to familiarize yourself withÂ the draft syllabus (attached).

Thanks, and see you Wednesday night!

\- Professor Rossetti
