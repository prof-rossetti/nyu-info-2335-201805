    + Control Flow ([Break and Continue from Loops](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops))
    + [Raising and Handling Errors](/notes/programming-languages/python/errors.md)

## Projects

We will spend a majority of class time working independently on the following project:

  + [Point-of-Sale App](/projects/point-of-sale-app/project.md)

At certain times during class, we will convene to share solutions to various parts of this project.
