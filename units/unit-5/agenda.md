# Unit 5 Agenda

## Objectives

Learn how to incorporate automated testing into your development process to save time and improve the quality of your applications.

## Projects

By now, some of you are further along in your [Inventory Management App](/projects/inventory-app/project.md) development than others. Regardless of how far along you are, there will be around 60-90 minutes of class time to continue working on your project.

If you have already finished implementing the core required functionality, use the time to address one or more of the ["Further Exploration" exercises](/projects/inventory-app/further.md), then get a head start on reading through the written materials on testing and package management (below), then complete the Automated Testing Exercise (below), then move on to testing your Inventory Management App.

Otherwise, use the time to address the basic project requirements.

After everyone has more time to work on the app, we will re-convene to share some partial solutions and learn how to test it.
