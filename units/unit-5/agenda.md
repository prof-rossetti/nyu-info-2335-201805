# Unit 5 Agenda

Before we get started, could you please try running the following command from the command-line, and let me know if you run into errors? We want to make sure you will be able to install packages for upcoming classes. If `pip` isn't working for you due to versioning issues, we might have to use another tool called `pipenv`. So yeah, if you run into errors, please post them into the [`#pip` channel on Slack](https://nyu-info-2335.slack.com/messages/CAZ30403U/). Thank you!!!

```sh
# For Homebrew-installed Python 3.x on Mac OS:
pip3 install ipython pytest requests

# All others:
pip install ipython pytest requests
```
