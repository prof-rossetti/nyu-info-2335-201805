## Objectives

Learn about version control, a software development best practice. And become familiar with how to incorporate it into your development process.

## Discussions and Notes

  + Version Control and [Git](/notes/git/notes.md)
  + [Command-line Git](/notes/git/cli.md) (optional further exploration, otherwise it is fine to use a GUI app for version control purposes)

## Ungraded Exercises

  + [Version Control Exercise](/exercises/version-control/exercise.md)

Don't worry about trying to finish this exercise during class. See if you can at least setup a local repository, make a few commits, and push your local repository to a GitHub remote address.

## Projects

  + [Stock Recommendation App](/projects/stocks-app/project.md), continued

FYI: here is an [example partial project solution](https://github.com/s2t2/stocks-app-py-2018).

If you are feeling comfortable in your development efforts thus far, see if you can start incorporating version control and automated testing into your development process. Consider referencing the example solution's [tests](https://github.com/s2t2/stocks-app-py-2018/tree/master/tests) and [commit history](https://github.com/s2t2/stocks-app-py-2018/commits/master).

Otherwise, just focus on satisfying the basic required functionality. And consider referencing the example solution's [app](https://github.com/s2t2/stocks-app-py-2018/blob/master/app/robo_adviser.py) for inspiration.
