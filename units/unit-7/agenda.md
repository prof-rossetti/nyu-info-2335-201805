# Unit 7 Agenda

By now you are most likely in the middle of developing your [Stock Recommendation App](/projects/stocks-app/project.md). Take as much time during class to continue to work on it. Maybe check in with this [example partial solution](https://github.com/s2t2/stocks-app-py-2018) for inspiration. Whenever you are ready to move on, start familiarizing yourself with the material from this unit, hopefully sometime before the next class.
