# Unit 4 Agenda

## Objectives

Learn how to use Python to process CSV files.

## Discussions and Notes

  + Datastores, Databases, and CSV Files
  + Python Language:
    + [Text File Management](/notes/programming-languages/python/file-management.md)
    + The [`csv`](/notes/programming-languages/python/modules/csv.md) Module

## Ungraded Exercises

  + [CSV Processing](/exercises/csv-processing/exercise.md) - (a.k.a Monthly Sales Reporting)

## Projects

  + [Inventory Management App](/projects/inventory-app/project.md) - (a.k.a "CRUD" App)

## Further Exploration (Advanced)

If you know SQL and you are familiar with MySQL or PostgreSQL, you can use one of the following packages to execute SQL queries against a relational database:

  + Third-party Python Packages:
    + The [`PyMySQL`](/notes/programming-languages/python/packages/pymysql.md) Package
    + The [`psycopg2`](/notes/programming-languages/python/packages/psycopg.md) Package

There will be an opportunity to further explore these packages later in the semester, if desired.
