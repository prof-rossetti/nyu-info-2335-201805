# Inventory Management App

## Checkpoints

### Checkpoint I - User Inputs

  1. Print a menu which contains a greeting message and a hard-coded number of products and a list of available operations.
  1. Using the aforementioned menu, prompt the user to choose one of the available operations, and print the name of the chosen operation.
  1. Implement a single "handler" function (or a simple "if" statement) to recognize the chosen operation and invoke one of a handful of new operation-specific functions to perform the chosen operation. For example, if the user chooses "Create", have your program invoke a function called `create_product()` to print the name of the chosen operation (e.g. "CREATING A NEW PRODUCT").
  1. Handle invalid operation inputs by displaying a helpful message like "Unrecognized Operation. Please choose one of: 'List', 'Show', 'Create', 'Update', or 'Destroy'."

After demonstrating your ability to properly prompt the user for inputs, feel free to comment-out all your user input-related code as you move on to implementing and testing the remaining functionality. If you do, remember to un-comment the input-related code and hook it back up to the remaining functionality once implemented.

### Checkpoint II - Reading and Writing to CSV File

> HINT: Don't try to locate certain lines within the CSV file.
Instead, read the entire CSV file into a list of dictionaries,
then manipulate that list as appropriate,
then write the entire list to the CSV file when the program is finished with execution.
See also [the `csv` module](/notes/programming-languages/python/modules/csv.md).

#### Reading

  1. Demonstrate your ability to loop through each product in the inventory and print the name of each.
  1. Demonstrate your ability to print the number of products in the inventory.
  1. Re-configure the user input menu to use the real number of products instead of a hard-coded value. This will require you to read the CSV file before prompting the user for inputs.

#### Writing

  1. Read the existing inventory of products from `products_app/db/products_default.csv` and write its contents to a new `products_app/db/products.csv` file.
  1. Read the existing inventory of products from the `products_app/db/products.csv` file and overwrite that same file with its same contents.

### Checkpoint III - CRUD Operations

  1. Implement the "List" operation. HINT: loop through a list of product dictionaries like you have done before.
  1. Implement the "Show" operation.
  1. Implement the "Create" operation.
  1. Implement the "Destroy" operation.
  1. Implement the "Update" operation last, as it uses a combination of techniques shared with the "Show" and "Create" operations.

> HINT: for the "Show", "Destroy", and "Update" operations, before you perform the desired action, you first need to look up a product given its identifier. To do this, you should be able to use list filtering technique (i.e. a list comprehension) similar to what you have done before.

> HINT: for the "Create" and "Update" operations, you will most likely need to prompt the user to input additional information, like the value for each product attribute.

> HINT: for "Create", "Update", and "Destroy" operations, as long as you are using a file-writing strategy that loops through each product and writes it to file, it should be sufficient to simply modify or add or remove an item from the existing list of products before writing them to file.
