# Freestyle Project Proposal

> Prerequisite: [Freestyle Project Description](project.md)

## Instructions

Create a new repository and place inside it a file called `PLANNING.md`, and place inside the following document template:


    # Project Planning

    ## Problem Statement

    todo: describe the problem and user needs (see proposal instructions)

    ## Information Requirements

    ### Information Inputs

    todo: describe information inputs (see proposal instructions)

    ### Information Outputs

    todo: describe information outputs (see proposal instructions)

    ## Technology Requirements

    ### APIs and Web Service Requirements

    todo: describe which APIs or web services, if any, the system will use (see proposal instructions)

    ### Python Package Requirements

    todo: describe which third-party python packages, if any, the system will use (see proposal instructions)

    ### Hardware Requirements

    todo: describe hardware requirements, if any (see proposal instructions)



As you complete each of the requirements below, replace the "todo..." lines with real content resulting from your project planning efforts. For an example planning document, see the [professor's example project planning document](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/repo-evaluator-py/blob/master/PLANNING.md).

Your project proposal should adhere to the following requirements, as detailed in the sections below:

  + Problem Statement
  + Information Requirements
  + Technology Requirements





### Problem Statement

Provide a **description of the problem** your project is trying to solve, including **statements of user needs** and descriptions of "as-is" and "to-be" processes.

If you get stuck, think about the following questions:

  + Who are the application's primary users? NOTE: it's fine if you are the primary user.
  + What are the user's needs?
  + What problem does the application solve?
  + What is the application's desired functionality?
  + How does the application improve upon existing user processes, or enable new capabilities?

### Information Requirements

Identify the application's **information inputs** and **information outputs**.

If you get stuck, think about the following questions:

  + What information inputs does the system require in order to achieve its desired functionality? Where do these inputs come from? What is the data format of these inputs?
  + What information outputs does the system produce in the process of achieving its desired functionality? What will be the data format of these outputs?


### Technology Requirements

Perform some preliminary research and investigation into how your proposed solution will work, and provide a written description of the results.

If you get stuck, think about the following questions:


  + What **APIs or web services**, if any, might your application require in order to produce its desired functionality? Have you read their documentation or tried using them? How is it going? Please include links to API docs.
  + What **third-party Python packages**, if any, might your application require in order to produce its desired functionality? Have you read their documentation or tried using them? How is it going? Please include links to package docs. And you are encouraged to include any early-stage Python code demonstrating your early-stage attempts to use the prerequisite package(s).
  + What **hardware** will your application run on? Your personal machine or some public server?


## Submission Instructions

By this time, students should be able to replicate the submission instructions from previous deliverables, abbreviated and adapted below to include considerations for ideally using a Git client of choice instead of the GitHub.com online interface, when applicable.

### Step 1 - Creating a new Project Repo

Create a new repository using either the GitHub.com online interface and/or a local Git client application.

If you are using a local Git client application, make sure to push/sync your local repo to a remote address on GitHub.com.

### Step 2 - Forking the Course Repo

If you have not yet already forked the course repository, do so now.

Otherwise, if you have already forked the course repository
(i.e. if you have already submitted a previous exercise),
then you will need to update your existing fork instead.

### Step 3 - Submitting a Pull Request

Add a new record to the [submissions file](submissions.csv),
to include your GitHub username and the repository's URL (e.g. `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/my-freestyle-project`).
After updating your own fork, you will need to submit a Pull Request
for your content to be accepted into the main course repository. Before you update your fork, make sure you don't have any outstanding [pull requests](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/pulls).

> NOTE: If you are working with a group of students, the `github_username` value of the project submissions file should contain the github usernames of all team members, listed inside double-quotes, and separated by commas (e.g. `"first_user, second_user, third_user"`).

## Evaluation

Submissions will be evaluated based on their ability to meet each of the component requirements (see corresponding sections above for detailed instructions):

Category | Weight
--- | ---
Problem Statement, Statement of User Needs | 30%
Information Inputs | 25%
Information Outputs | 25%
Technology Requirements | 20%

This rubric is tentative, and may be subject to slight adjustments during the grading process.
