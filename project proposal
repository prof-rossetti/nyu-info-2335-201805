Final Project Proposal

For my final project, I propose creating an app that will give me different information on medications. I will be using an API from openFDA, which provides public FDA data on drugs.

My plan is to pour over the data in openFDA to see what information I can glean, and then create an app whereby one can enter the name of a drug, and get a variety of information on it. If possible, I would also like for a user to have a “compare” option, that is, to enter the name of two drugs and see how they react to each other. 

Lastly, I would pull data from the BetterDoctor API for a user of my app to get more information on a specific drug. Based on the information in the API, I would look to see if I can match the treatment for the given drug with a doctor that specializes in that illness.  

This app would be run from the command line.
