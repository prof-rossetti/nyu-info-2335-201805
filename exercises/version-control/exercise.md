# Version Control Exercise

> Prerequisites: [Git Overview](/notes/git/notes.md)

## Objectives

Practice incorporating version control into your development process.

## Setup

Choose and install a Git client, whether it be a [command-line utility](/notes/git/cli.md#installation) or a [GUI application](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).

You will use this chosen Git client to perform version control-related tasks as you complete the instructions below.

## Instructions

Revisit and re-create the [Python Datatypes Exercise](/exercises/python-datatypes/exercise.md), except practice version control during the development process.

When you [setup](/exercises/python-datatypes/exercise.md#setup) your directory, also initialize a Git repository and make your first commit with a message like "Setup repo".

Then, work through each of the [checkpoint challenges](/exercises/python-datatypes/exercise.md#checkpoints) individually, committing your changes after implementing each.

By the time you are done, you will have produced a complete version history similar to this [example history](https://github.com/s2t2/groceries-project/commits/master).

> NOTE: The point about this example is not about the code it uses, but rather how it was developed incrementally. Feel free to implement whatever code you'd like to solve the checkpoint challenges, and don't feel constrained by the code contained in the example solution. If you previously submitted this exercise, you can leverage your previous submission, or you can start again from scratch - the choice is yours!

When you are done, optionally push your repository to GitHub using your Git Client (NOT the GitHub.com online interface) and [optionally submit it here](submissions.csv).
