# Command-line Computing Exercise

The command-line is an essential and fundamental part of programming.

Throughout the semester, we will be using the command-line to navigate and manage our computer's local filesystem. We'll also use it to execute Python programs and other command-line utilities (CLIs). You will also read various commands online and in the course materials, and you will need to know how to interpret them and adapt them as necessary and applicable.

So before we start, we need to achieve a basic level of familiarity and comfort with using the command line.
