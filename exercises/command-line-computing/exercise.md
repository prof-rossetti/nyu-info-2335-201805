# Command-line Computing Exercise

The command-line is an essential and fundamental part of programming.

Throughout the semester, we will be using the command-line to navigate and manage our computer's local filesystem. We'll also use it to execute Python programs and other command-line utilities (CLIs). You will also read various commands online and in the course materials, and you will need to know how to interpret them and adapt them as necessary and applicable.

So before we start, we need to achieve a basic level of familiarity and comfort with using the command-line.

## Instructions

See one of the following guides, based on your operating system:

  + [Using Terminal on Mac OS](mac-terminal.md)
  + [Using Command Prompt on Windows OS](windows-command-prompt.md)

> NOTE: most online programming instructions are written for a Mac audience, so students using a Windows computer will need to gain a basic level of familiarity with the Mac equivalents, so if they read Mac commands online they will know how to translate and adapt them for Windows.
