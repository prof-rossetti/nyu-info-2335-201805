# Human Software Exercise

Before we start writing instructions for the computer, let's warm up by writing instructions for other humans. By doing so, we will learn about issues, challenges, and considerations relevant when writing software in general.

> ADVICE: writing software is less about computers or programming languages than it is about how you see the world, paying attention to detail, and anticipating all possible outcomes.

## Instructions

Pick two processes or activities you engage in on a daily basis. One should be the process of brushing your teeth. The other is your choice.

For each process, write instructions in English to communicate to another human, perhaps even a child, how to perform that process.

If you have already [set up your development environment](/exercises/dev-environment-setup/exercise.md), use a combination of the command-line and a text editor to create a new empty folder somewhere on your machine, perhaps on your Desktop, and place inside it a new Markdown file called `instructions.md`. If you have not yet learned about command-line computing, you can record your notes in a regular word processor for the time being.

Record your instructions in the `instructions.md` file (or your word processor). You might consider using the following template which leverages [Markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf):

    # Human Software

    Author: YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME

    ## Brushing Teeth

    Some written instructions here. Maybe numbered:

      1. Do something.
      2. Do something else.
      3. Do a third thing.

    ## My Other Process

    Some written instructions here. Maybe numbered:

      1. Do something.
      2. Do something else.
      3. Do a third thing.

## Submission Instructions

> Submission of this exercise is optional. At this point, you may not yet have been instructed on how to submit deliverables to the course repository, but this is a good opportunity to see if you can figure it out on your own. Students who complete the submission process before the beginning of the second class will receive extra credit. You are encouraged to ask questions and help each other on Slack!

### Step 1 - Creating a new Repo ([Video Walkthrough](https://youtu.be/DT1d3vQ9kHM)):

Use the GitHub.com online interface to create a new GitHub repository under your control called "human-software". When you create a new repository, in order to easily use the GitHub.com online interface, check the box to **Initialize this repository with a README**. Once the repository is created, add a file to it called `instructions.md`. Paste your instructions into that file, then save and commit it. At this time you should be able to view your instructions online at your repository's URL.


### Step 2 - Submitting a Pull Request ([Video Walkthrough](https://youtu.be/TKEEwue1BV0)):

After you have committed your file to your own repo, "Fork" the course repository under your own control, then add a new record to the [submissions file](submissions.csv), to include your GitHub username and the repository's URL (e.g. https://github.com/s2t2/human-software). After updating your own fork, you will need to submit a Pull Request for your content to be accepted into the main course repository.
