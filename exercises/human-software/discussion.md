# Human Software

> 2018 PROFESSOR'S NOTE: this semester we didn't devote enough time to this exercise. Ideally it is conducted by allowing students time to write the instructions independently, then share and discuss with a partner, then finally volunteer take-aways with the class. That's like 45 minutes maybe. Not 17.

## Discussion Topics

  + What is the scope of your instructions? Did you assume the user was already in the bathroom? Did you assume the toothpaste supply was infinite? What were your assumptions?
  + Did you number your instructions sequentially, or no? Why or why not?
  + How many steps?
  + Is it possible for the user to experience unintended functionality (i.e. a "bug")?

## Key Terms and Concepts

  + **User**
  + **User Experience**
  + **Bug**
