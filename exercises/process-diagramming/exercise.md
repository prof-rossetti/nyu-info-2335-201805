# Process Diagramming Exercise

> Prerequisites: [Process Diagrams](/notes/information-systems/diagramming.md#process-diagrams)

## Challenges

### Challenge I: Diagramming Organizational Processes

Revisit your submission for the [Human Software Exercise](/exercises/human-software/exercise.md), and translate one or more of your written process descriptions into process diagrams.

### Challenge II: Diagramming System Processes

Revisit your submission for the [Inventory Management App](/projects/inventory-app/project.md), and/or the [Stocks App](/projects/stocks-app/project.md), and for each: create a process diagram to visually document the system's logic.

### Challenge III: Business Process Improvement

First, identify a business process you think could be improved in terms of its effectiveness and/or efficiency.

Then write a detailed and organized description of the "as-is" process, and visually document it by creating an "as-is" process diagram.

Finally, brainstorm ways to improve the process, write a detailed and organized "to-be" process description, and visually document it by creating a "to-be" process diagram.
