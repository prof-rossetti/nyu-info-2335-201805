# Automated Testing Exercise

## Objectives

Practice writing and executing automated tests for your Python applications.

## Prerequisites

To setup these examples, create a new directory on your Desktop called "testing-123" and navigate there from your command line:

```sh
cd Desktop
mkdir testing-123
cd testing-123/
```

If you haven't already, you will need to install [the `pytest` package](/notes/programming-languages/python/packages/pytest.md), using either Pip or Pipenv, whichever works for you:

```sh
# For Pipenv users (Mac or Windows), run from a project's root directory:
pipenv install pytest --dev

# For Homebrew-installed Python 3.x on Mac OS:
pip3 install pytest

# All others:
pip install pytest
```

## Instructions

Follow along with the [two examples from the `pytest` package notes](/notes/programming-languages/python/packages/pytest.md#usage).
