# Welcome to Slack Exercise

We're going to be using Slack throughout the semester to communicate with eachother, and to share code snippets and links to helpful resources.

Let's take this time to get familiarized with the platform. This should be especially helpful if you haven't used Slack before.

## Instructions

### Joining

On the first day of class, the professor sent invitation emails to the NYU addresses of all enrolled students. Stern students should check their `stern.nyu.edu` email addresses, and other students should check their `nyu.edu` email addresses. If you don't see an invitation email, or if you enrolled late, immediately email the professor to request access.

### Getting Started

After gaining access to https://nyu-info-2335.slack.com/, take a moment to set up your profile and account settings. For example, you might want to update your display name and/or your profile photo.

When you get a moment later on, you are encouraged to [enable two-factor authentication](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204509068-Set-up-two-factor-authentication) to enhance the security of our organization. Also consider downloading the Slack app to your mobile device and configuring your notification preferences.

### Exploring

After gaining access, you might want to take the guided tour or consult this [guided tour document](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/217626358-Tour-the-Slack-app).

When you are ready, please take the following actions:

  1. Send an introductory message like "Hello World" to the `#2335` channel. Optionally include a fun emoji in your message.
  2. View messages posted by other students in the `#2335` channel, and [add an emoji reaction](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/206870317-Emoji-reactions) to someone else's message.
  3. Send a direct message (DM) to yourself, and/or a friend, and/or `@prof-rossetti`.
  4. DM yourself a few times as you play around with [message formatting](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages#code-blocks), including [code snippets](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204145658-Create-a-snippet).
  5. Browse existing channels and consider joining them. Perhaps the only channel you have not yet been automatically invited to is `#2335-dev`. If you don't feel like joining, no pressure, just know that it exists and know you can search periodically for channels to join.
  5. When you have a free moment, to start preparing for the [Industry Insights Assignment](/assignments/industry-insights/assignment.md), consider searching meetup.com for business or technology or [Python-related events in the NYC area](https://www.meetup.com/find/events/?allMeetups=false&keywords=python&radius=10&userFreeform=New+York%2C+New+York%2C+USA&mcId=c10001&change=yes&eventFilter=all), and if you find an event that looks interesting, post a link to the `#events` channel. If you see an interesting link posted by another student, [start a thread](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115000769927-Message-threads) to further discuss the possibly of attending together.

And now you know how to Slack! :tada:
