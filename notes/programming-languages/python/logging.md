# Python Language Overview

## Logging

Output, or "log" an object by passing it as a parameter into a `print()` statement. Printing works from inside an interactive shell as well as inside a script. If scripting, when the script executes you will see the printed logs output onto the command-line.

```python
print("HELLO WORLD") #> HELLO WORLD
```

You can even log multiple objects, including various types of objects, by separating each with a comma:

```python
print("HELLO", "WORLD") #> HELLO WORLD
print("HELLO", "WORLD", 5, {'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': 2}) #> HELLO WORLD 5 {'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': 2}
```
